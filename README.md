## About
The pomodoro clock makes use of the pomodoro technique which is a great time-management method. The user can adjust the duration of stretches of focused work, followed by break periods, for as many rotations as required. They may also pause, resume and reset the timer as desired.  
This project was made for freeCodeCamp's final [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock) project. The majority of the pomodoro clock was built using react as an opportunity to improve my skills using a front end framework.
<br/><br/>
These are some of the challenges I faced while making this project:
- Becoming more familiar with the React framework
- Creating the countdown functionality
- Ensuring the end of each session or break continued in to the next once the timer reached 00:00
